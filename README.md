## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)     

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)
